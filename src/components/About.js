          <p>
            I am a student at NIIT (National
            institute of information technology) currently studying software
            development. I focus more on backend development because it was the
            first field I started with. I got into coding during COVID 19
            pandemic when I downloaded Mimo app. Moving further, i learnt HTML,
            CSS, Javascript and Python. I also watched online tutorials. My
            parents discovered my interest in computer science and then enrolled
            me at NIIT. Aside coding, i like to play games and watch movies.
